# CS677 Data Science with Python, End of Term Project
## Smoker-Drinker Classification
End of Term Project for MET CS 677 - Data Science with Python

For my project, I am going to leverage different machine learning classifiers explored over the course of the semester. 

The aim is to determine which model can accuractely classify an individual as a drinker and/or smoker based on various factors and values

### Dataset

Soo.Y. (2023, August 30). Smoking and drinking dataset with body signal. Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sooyoungher/smoking-drinking-dataset/data

Within the dataset, exist two target columns:

  1) SMK_stat_type_cd - Smoking state, 1(never), 2(used to smoke but quit), 3(still smoke)
  2) DRK_YN - Drinker or Not
